# E-commerce-Customer-Churn-Prediction-Segmentation-Python-ML
Build a churn model and segment churned users to support targeted retention offers and operational improvements.

## What this project is about

Customer churn is a critical challenge for e-commerce businesses, as losing existing customers directly impacts revenue and increases acquisition costs.

In this project, I analyzed customer behavior data to understand why customers churn, built a machine learning model to predict churn risk, and explored customer segmentation to support retention strategies.

Key outcomes from this project include:
- Identifying the main behavioral and operational drivers of churn, such as short tenure, low engagement, customer complaints, and delivery distance.
- Building a churn prediction model that prioritizes recall to minimize missed churned customers.
- Translating analytical insights into actionable business and operational recommendations to reduce churn.

## Industry Context

In the e-commerce industry, customer churn is a common challenge due to intense competition, low switching costs, and high customer expectations around pricing, delivery speed, and service quality.
Retaining existing customers is often more cost-effective than acquiring new ones, making churn analysis a key priority for growth and profitability.

## 📌 Background & Overview

This project focuses on analyzing customer-level behavioral and operational data to understand churn patterns in an e-commerce business.

By combining exploratory analysis and machine learning, the project aims to move beyond descriptive reporting and support data-driven retention decisions, such as identifying high-risk customers and prioritizing intervention efforts.

### **🎯 Objective**
The objective of this project is to:
- Identify key behavioral and operational factors that contribute to customer churn.

- Support retention strategies by translating analytical findings into actionable business recommendations.

### **❓Business Question**
- What behavioral and operational patterns distinguish churned customers from retained customers?
- Which factors have the strongest impact on customer churn risk?
- How can churn prediction be used to identify high-risk customers for early intervention?
